# Project1
## Objective
The objective of this platform is to facilitate efficient problem-solving collaboration. It connects individuals or organizations facing challenges (Problem Providers) with experts or teams (Solvers) who can propose solutions privately.

## Overview
This full-stack web application is inspired by Smart India Hackathon (SIH) and provides a structured way for users to submit problems and receive personalized solutions. The platform supports two user roles:
1. **Problem Providers** - Users who submit problem statements with requirement, urgency.
2. **Solvers** - Users who review the problems and provide solutions personally to the respective problem providers.

## Workflow
1. **User Registration & Authentication**: Users sign up as either Problem Providers or Solvers.
2. **Problem Submission**: Problem Providers submit detailed problem statements.
3. **Problem Assignment**: Problems are reviewed and assigned to Solvers.
